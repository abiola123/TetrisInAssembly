# Tetris in Assembly

This project was part of the Computer Architecture CS208 course.

It's aim was is the implementation of the well known TETRIS game in assembly.

We were provided Gecko4EPFL boards which are special FPGA's that look like this:

Once that the code was loaded to the FPGA:

1. The user could see his score on the screen of the FPGA
2. The user could use the buttons on the FPGA to flip the pieces and move them in the required directions
3. Reset and start a new game

The final result ressembles to what you can see in this video:
